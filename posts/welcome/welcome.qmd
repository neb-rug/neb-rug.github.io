We are excited to kickoff the Nebraska R User Group! This group is for anyone in Nebraska who is interested in using R for statistics, data visualization, machine learning, and more. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced R user, this group is a great opportunity to network with like-minded individuals, share resources and tips, and collaborate on projects. Join us for regular meetups, workshops, and discussions to deepen your R programming skills and explore new possibilities in data analysis. Let's come together to learn, grow, and advance our data science journey with R!

To kickoff this group, we will have our first meeting on October 29th at the Center for Brain, Biology & Behavior inside Memorial Stadium on the University of Nebraska-Lincoln campus. Check out our [events page](../../events.qmd) and join our [Meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/neb-rug/) to find out about a future (and past) events. We hope to see you at our kickoff meeting!
