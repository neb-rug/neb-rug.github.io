<p>We are excited to kickoff the Nebraska R User Group! This group is for anyone in Nebraska who is interested in using R for statistics, data visualization, machine learning, and more. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced R user, this group is a great opportunity to network with like-minded individuals, share resources and tips, and collaborate on projects. Join us for regular meetups, workshops, and discussions to deepen your R programming skills and explore new possibilities in data analysis. Letâ€™s come together to learn, grow, and advance our data science journey with R!</p>
<p>To kickoff this group, we will have our first meeting on October 29th at the Center for Brain, Biology &amp; Behavior inside Memorial Stadium on the University of Nebraska-Lincoln campus. Check out our <a href="../../events.html">events page</a> and join our <a href="https://www.meetup.com/neb-rug/">Meetup group</a> to find out about a future (and past) events. We hope to see you at our kickoff meeting!</p>
